# 6.s079-college-rankings

The code for cleaning the data, attempting to replicate the data, and analyzing historical trends is in the files college.ipynb and college.py

The code for calculating Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient is in the files exploring_noise_college.ipynb and exploring_noise_college.py

The code for analyzing normal distribution of movement across the rankings is in the files finding_distribution_in_noise_college.ipynb and finding_distribution_in_noise_college.py

The 5 data files we used are in the data/ directory

The code to compute correlations and compare admission statistics and rankings is in the correlations directory. There is a seperate README there that described how to run various files and produce different visualizations of our analysis.

To run the files, either clone or download the entire directory and install any required dependencies. Then simply run the Jupyter Notebook or Python file, whichever is preferred.
